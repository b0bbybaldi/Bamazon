# Bamazon
 

Bamazon is an Amazon emulator project created for an assignment which allows users to interact in the console to buy from the consumer app out of a list of items with stock quantities tied to a mySQL database.

The project works with javascript, using node and downloadable node components that allow for API interactivity with user and further program dynamics. NPM programs installed which allow users to input command and get expected results are: spotify, request, ombd, and twitter. 

It also relies heavily on the use of mySQL databases for functionality. 

## Check it out here:

## Built using:

Javascript, Node, Inquirer, MySQL, Request,Console or Terminal for Mac users

## How to use:

Users have to initialize code using npm init -y command in Terminal once they are in the folder with liri.js file. Once initiated and JSON package created then the modules should be installed using the npm install command. 

Once all packages have been installed then the program can run using node bamazonCustomer.js to run the Consumer App. This app will display a list of product out of which user will choose type and quantity, then the program will check if there is enough stock, if there is it will ouput a total and update the new quantity, if not it will prompt for something else. This projects handles user error when inputing values.
